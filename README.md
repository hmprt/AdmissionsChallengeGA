# AdmissionsChallengeGA
A short General Assembly Data Analysis challenge for admissions

Using numpy, pandas and seaborn I analysed publicly-available data from https://kickstarter.com to infer the best funding goals, categories, months and durations of succesful kickstarter campaigns. I gained valuable experience in using Python to interpret real-world data, and worked hard to make my output graphs readable, clear and aesthetically pleasing - these are all visible in the /output folder!
